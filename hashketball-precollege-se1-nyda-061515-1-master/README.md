# Hashketball

## Instructions

Great news! You're going to an NBA game! The only catch is that you've been volunteered to keep stats at the game.

Using Nested Hashes, define a game, with two teams, their players, and the players stats:

* The game has two teams
* A team has:
  * name
  * colors (x2)
* Each player should have a:
  * name
  * jersey_number
  * shoe_size
* Each player should have the following stats:
  * points
  * rebounds
  * assists
  * steals
  * blocks
  * slam_dunks

Use the following seed data to structure your game hash as suggested above. When designing your nested hash structure think about how one might want to access the data. 
Remember to run `learn` to see what the tests expect. 

* Home Team = Brooklyn Nets, Colors = Black, White
* Away Team = Charlotte Hornets, Colors = Turquoise, Purple

Using the power of Ruby, and the hashes you created, write methods to complete the following:

1. Returns your game hash. Call the method `game_hash`.

2. Return the number of points scored for any player, given that player's name as a string. Call the method `num_points_scored`.

3. Return the shoe size for any player, given that player's name. Call the method `shoe_size`.

4. Return both colors for any team, given the team name. Call the method `team_colors`.

5. Return both teams names, given the game_hash. Call the method `team_names`. Note: Since you have a method `game_hash` that
returns your hash, there is no need to pass it in as an argument! You can just call it from within your `team_names` method.

6. Return all the player numbers for a team, given a team name. Call the method `player_numbers`.

7. Return all the stats for a player, given a player's name. The stats should be returned as a hash, which each
stat name as a key and the corresponding stat as a value. Call the method `player_stats`. eg:

    ```bash
    player_stats("Alan Anderson")
    => { :number => 0,
         :shoe => 16,
         :points => 22,
         :rebounds => 12,
         :assists => 12,
         :steals => 3,
         :blocks => 1,
         :slam_dunks => 1
       }
    ```

8. Return the number of rebounds for the player with the largest shoe size. Call the method `big_shoe_rebounds`.

**Bonus Questions:**

Define methods to return the answer to the following questions:

1. Which player has the most points? Call the method `most_points_scored`.

2. Which team has the most points? Call the method `winning_team`.

3. Which player has the longest name? Call the method `player_with_longest_name`.

**Super Bonus:**

1. Write a method that returns true if the player with the longest name had the most steals. Call the method `long_name_steals_a_ton?`.
